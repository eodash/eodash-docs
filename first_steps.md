# First steps

The main idea of the eodash ecosystem is to allow any number of setups, such as only using individual components, integration of specific endpoints or dynamically configured clients based on some specialized user workspaces.

We still want to make sure that setting up the ecosystem can be easily managed by anyone. We have create some template repositories to help you achieve this.
These template repositories showcase integration into other frameworks giving you an idea of how you could introduce them into your own architecture.

We want to present basic use cases in a way that they can be used by themselves as well as to introduce you to how aspects of the ecosystem could be integrated into a service you manage.

As described in eodash ecosystem [concept](./welcome#concept) we need only two things for an eodash instance, a supported (STAC) catalog and a configured and deployed eodash instance.

We can achieve this by utilizing github pages capabilities. This is how the template repositories are set up, have a look at the [Catalog backend](./catalog) section to learn how to setup your own catalog deployment. Afterwards look into the [eodash instance](./eodash) section to learn how to deploy and configure your own instance.
