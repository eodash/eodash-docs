# Content integration

We see at least three ways for contributing content to an instantiated eodash ecosystem:
* Earth Observation Data
* Stories
* Additional static pages

Depending on the used setup an abstraction layer can have been placed on top to provide for example helpful user interfaces, like Content Management Systems (CMS) on top of the configuration and setup options, thus here we will talk about the "raw" git based content management.

More content to follow soon!
