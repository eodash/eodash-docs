# Content integration

We see at least three ways for contributing content to an instantiated eodash ecosystem:
* Earth Observation (related) data
* Stories for the [Storytelling](./storytelling) element
* Additional static pages

The basic process content submission is expected to be done through configuration and content files via a version control system such as git. Depending on how the eodash ecosystem is integrated into a platform it is possible that abstraction layers, such as custom user interfaces (such as Content Management Systems) or helper tools are build on top to help users of the platform.

As these can potentially differ quite widely, in the following sections we want to look at the basic concepts to provide an understanding of the process.
