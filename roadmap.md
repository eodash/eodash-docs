# Roadmap

This project tries to bring together experience and capabilities gathered working in Earth Observation related field.
This will be an iterative process which will also be influenced by potential community interactions.

We are grateful for inputs and thoughts in form of issues in respective components.
If you are unsure where to create an issue feel free to use the [eodash issue board](https://github.com/eodash/eodash/issues).

We want to note some roadmap steps that are potentially on the horizon to help stimulate discussion.
