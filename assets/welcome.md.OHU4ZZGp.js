The main tools are a web client dashboard library (eodash) as well as a catalog generator library that provide the basis for integration of many types of endpoints.</p><h2 id="concept" tabindex="-1">Concept <a class="header-anchor" href="#concept" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Concept&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="architecture concept figure"></p><p>The figure above shows the main components of the eodash ecosystem, as well as how they interact with each other.</p><p>The <strong>eodash <a href="https://github.com/eodash/eodash_catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">catalog</a></strong> is a helper python package which supports a series of commonly used serverless EO data endpoints as well as service endpoints, such as <a href="https://www.ogc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OGC</a> services, <a href="https://gitlab.eox.at/vs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ViewServer</a>, STAC catalogs, and others. By defining a collection configuration file an end user can provide a wide range of visualization and analysis definitions to describe how the data should be visualized on the eodash web client. The supported resources are described <a href="https://github.com/eurodatacube/eodash-catalog/wiki/Resource" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. The output of the catalog helper package is a static catalog (series of files), that can be hosted on any web server.</p><p>The generated static catalog is the input used by an <strong><a href="https://eodash.github.io/eodash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">eodash</a></strong> instance to populate the information shown. This includes descriptive text, assets, analysis functions and most importantly customizable EO data visualization through a series of configurable widgets. eodash provides a set of <strong>core widgets</strong> that can be configured to navigate and interact with the data. Third party widgets can be developed and integrated through the configuration by (for example) reacting to specific <strong>STAC extensions</strong> in the catalog.</p><p>For wider audiences the <a href="https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-eox-storytelling--docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">storytelling</a> component is envisioned. It provides an online editor (based on <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Markdown</a>) to create an interactive and guided experience. Results and datasets shown in eodash instances can be easily integrated. Field experts and communicators are able to create such content by utilizing the capabilities provided by eodash.</p>',17),i=[n];function h(c,d,l,p,u,g){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const f=e(r,[["render",h]]);export{b as __pageData,f as default};
